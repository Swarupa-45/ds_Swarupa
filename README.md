# Data Science Assignment 
### Candidate: Swarupa

##  Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between **market sentiment (Fear vs Greed)** and **trader behavior** using:

1. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset  
2. Hyperliquid Historical Trader Dataset  

The goal is to identify how trader actions (leverage, size, PnL, volatility) align or differ from the overall sentiment.

##  Summary of Work

### **1. Datasets Used**
- Fear & Greed Market Sentiment  
- Historical Trader Activity (PnL, leverage, volume, position size)

### **2. Insights from Charts**
- Fear/Greed cycles show clear changes in trader activity.  
- Leverage and trade size tend to increase during **Greed** phases.  

### **3. Fear vs Greed Behavior**
- Greed → aggressive positions, higher leverage  
- Fear → lower volume, risk-avoidance  

### **4. Trader Behavior Patterns**
- Consistent traders use stable leverage across all phases  
- Loss-making traders over-leverage during Greed periods  
- High volatility leads to rapid PnL swings

##  How to Reproduce
1. Upload both CSV datasets into Colab  
2. Run notebook_1.ipynb for EDA  
3. Run notebook_2.ipynb for ML classification  
4. All charts will be saved to `/outputs`  
5. Export final explanations to `report.pdf`

## Final Notes
- The folder strictly follows the structure required in the assignment.  
- Analysis and results are included in **report.pdf**.  
- All notebooks are publicly shareable via Google Colab.
